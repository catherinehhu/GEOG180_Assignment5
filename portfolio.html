                <iframe src="assets/site_suitability.pdf" width="100%" height="600px" title= "Site Suitability Map"></iframe>
                <p>Overview: This was a site suitability analysis done for GEOG 181A in Fall 2023 of the area between the Laguna and Cuyacama Mountains in San Diego County. 
                    I first created a relief map of the area with roads and created a capmsite suitability index based on features like elevation, slope, and access to roads and major cities. 
                    This was then translated to a color-graded display of suitable regions based on the highest scoring areas. 
                </p>
                <p>Areas of Improvement: While GEOG 181A taught me a lot about how to use GIS software effectively, there are a lot of visuals that probably could be improved. 
                    For example, the key on the second page and the color scale could have been made more prominently by increasing transparency on the basemap. Zooming the map 
                    in more to the areas of greatest interest or creating an inset map would have also been effective in highlighting the limited number of areas that were 
                    deemed as particularly. suitable.

                <p>Mapping Native Bee Sightings at UCLA [March - June 2023]</p>
                <p><i><a href = "https://gisucla.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=da66405670834478ab5ac3901997f392&locale=en-us" target="_blank">Open in another tab</a></i></p>
                <iframe src="https://gisucla.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=da66405670834478ab5ac3901997f392&locale=en-us" width="100%" height="600px" title="Bee Map"></iframe>                
                <p>Overview: This was a map I made as part of our Sustainable Action Research project last year on native bee populations on UCLA's campus. 
                    I made this map when I had no experience using ArcGIS Pro, but felt like it would be cool to put something together that showcased
                    the bee sightings we had made in our field surveys and simply by walking around campus.
                    I used existing shapefiles of UCLA's buildings, and imported a dataset of iNaturalist sightings (including the ones our team had made).</p>
                <p>Areas of Improvement: Since this map was made when I had very little exposure to ArcGIS, it gets the point across that we saw many different bees in different places,
                    but knowing what I know now about cartography, I definitely would have loved to spend more time on improving how the legend is displayed. Creating a stronger visual hierarchy
                    that brings the observation points into greater focus would have also been helpful for a map reader to more intuitively understand this map.
