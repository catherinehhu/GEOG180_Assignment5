                    <p><strong>Overview: </strong>This was the project that really started me down the GIS path. I took ASIAN AM 191A on a whim last year, and learned so much about critical cartography.
                        This was the course that inspired me to declare and officially pursue the minor, and I'm so glad that I did.
                        The bulk of this course focused on this final project, which was a group assignment focused on rethinking the idea of who and what makes a map a map.
                        This website is a prototype of a community engagement tool that seeks to elevate the stories of community members affected by oil drilling in this region, 
                        as opposed to telling the story of the oil wells themselves. This is intended to bring focus back to the community that is most impacted by the presence of these fields. 
                        This website was made using standard HTML/CSS/JS + Leaflet.js for mapping. 
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Areas of Improvement: </strong>Coming from a computer science background, I really enjoyed the accessibility aspect of web mapping and learning to use Leaflet instead of desktop software 
                        like ArcGIS, ENVI, or even QGIS. However, I think there were a lot of visuals that could be improved. If I had more time, I would have loved to incorporate more animations into the display
                        of the graphics on the side of the map and make them a little more intuitive.

                <p><i><a href = "assets/site_suitability.pdf" target="_blank">Open in another tab</a></i></p>
                <iframe src="assets/site_suitability.pdf" width="100%" height="600px" title= "Site Suitability Map"></iframe>
                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>This was a site suitability analysis done for GEOG 181A in Fall 2023 of the area between the Laguna and Cuyacama Mountains in San Diego County. 
                    I first created a relief map of the area with roads and created a capmsite suitability index based on features like elevation, slope, and access to roads and major cities. 
                    This was then translated to a color-graded display of suitable regions based on the highest scoring areas. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Areas of Improvement: </strong>While GEOG 181A taught me a lot about how to use GIS software effectively, there are a lot of visuals that probably could be improved. 
                    For example, the key on the second page and the color scale could have been made more prominently by increasing transparency on the basemap. Zooming the map 
                    in more to the areas of greatest interest or creating an inset map would have also been effective in highlighting the limited number of areas that were 
                    deemed as particularly suitable.

                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>This was one of my final assignments for GEOG 180, where I made a revised map of Yosemite National Park without using any green. I focused on different 
                symbology than the original map provided by the NPS and created my own labeling hierarchy. It was definitely one of the most challenging maps I've made, but one that I am very proud to have completed. </p>
                <p><strong>Areas of Improvement: </strong>Due to web map sharing issues, I had to sacrifice the hillshade layer for the sake of map loading times. I definitely want to keep 
                playing around with this map and the visuals of the labels. </p>

                        <h3>Mapping Native Bee Sightings at UCLA [March - June 2023]</h3>
                <p><i><a href = "https://gisucla.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=da66405670834478ab5ac3901997f392&locale=en-us" target="_blank">Open in another tab</a></i></p>

                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>I made this map as part of our Sustainable Action Research project last year on native bee populations on UCLA's campus. 
                    I made this map when I had no experience using ArcGIS Pro, but felt like it would be cool to put something together that showcased
                    the bee sightings we had made in our field surveys and simply by walking around campus.
                    I used existing shapefiles of UCLA's buildings, and imported a dataset of iNaturalist sightings (including the ones our team had made).</p>
                <p><strong>Areas of Improvement: </strong>Since this map was made when I had very little exposure to ArcGIS, it gets the point across that we saw many different bees in different places,
                    but knowing what I know now about cartography, I definitely would have loved to spend more time on improving how the legend is displayed. Creating a stronger visual hierarchy
                    that brings the observation points into greater focus would have also been helpful for a map reader to more intuitively understand this map.
